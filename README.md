## Development Notes

### Current Architecture Decisions
- **User Isolation**: Each user operates with their own data scope
- **Simple Authentication**: Development-friendly auth flow
- **Flexible API**: Both full-featured and simplified API endpoints
- **Database Per User**: SQLite provides user-specific data isolation

### Known Limitations
- Single-tenant architecture (not multi-tenant database)
- Development-mode authentication (simplified for testing)
- Basic receipt system (no printing integration yet)

## Future Roadmap

### Planned Features
- **Barcode Scanning**: Camera-based barcode recognition
- **Receipt Printing**: Thermal printer integration
- **Advanced Analytics**: Sales trends, profit analysis
- **Customer Management**: Customer database and loyalty
- **Multi-Store Support**: Chain store management
- **Offline Capability**: Work without internet connection
- **Cloud Backup**: Data synchronization and backup
- **Mobile Payment Integration**: Payment gateway APIs

### Technical Improvements
- **Multi-tenant Database**: Shared database with tenant isolation
- **Advanced Authentication**: OAuth2, social login
- **Caching Layer**: Redis for performance optimization
- **API Rate Limiting**: Request throttling and quotas
- **Automated Testing**: Unit and integration test suites
- **Docker Deployment**: Containerized deployment
- **Cloud Hosting**: AWS/Azure deployment configurations
